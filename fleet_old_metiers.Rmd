```


# Data 

Input a list of all metiers used `r min(dfad$year)`-`r max(dfad$year)` in the data. 

# Check merged_metier_level6

merged_metier_level6 is used as input to the code. 
This is already a re-coded of the old

```{r}

diff <- subset(fleet, merged_metier_level6 != metier_level6_ret & 
                 !(metier_level6_ret %in% c("No_logbook6_>10", "No_logbook6",

                 substr(merged_metier_level6, 5, 7) != "MCD")

```

# Check 

# mixfish_fleet


Also need a mixfish_fleet for saithe, haddock and cod
